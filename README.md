# Cipher Text

A Vigenère Cipher that could follow a code from a plaintext of user's message and key. In which it only accept UPPERCASE LETTERS

# Example of what this program do
- Message: LETSGOTOTHESHOW

_which is equivalent to =      11 4 19 18 6 14 19 14 19 7 4 18 7 14 22_

- Key: TICKET

_which is also equivalent to = 19 8 2 10  4 19 19  8 2 10 4 19 19 8 2_

- Add each column: 30 12 21 28 10 33 38 22 21 17 8 37 26 22 24

There would be a possibility that it will reach more than 26 which make it not equal to english alphabet.

- In that thought if the sum of it exceed 26 minus it to 26

_Which resulted to this..._
Mod: 4 12 21 2 10 7 12 22 21 17 8 11 0 22 24

- The answer now can be translate to its english alphabet equivalent.

Ciphertext: E M V C K H M W V R I L A W Y
